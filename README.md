## Set 2

4. Special Pythagorean triplet
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^
For example, 3^2^ + 4^2^ = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2^.
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

5. 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a program to find the smallest number that can be divided by all the numbers from 1 to 20 without leaving a remainder.

6. Print all the prime numbers between 1 and 99999

7. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Set 3

8. Create a binary tree class. Overload the ‘+’ operator to behave as an node insertion, ‘-‘ operator to behave as a node deletion. This should be strictly written in Python.
